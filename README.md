# registryTool

The purpose of RegSim is to visually simulate behavior of Windows OS (XP and higher) after making changes to registry files. 

Two main features of RegSim are: 
 - registry change interface
 - graphical simulator of Windows OS
 
Usage scenario:
 
User needs to make some changes in Windows registry, but is afraid of the side effects of them. Also, doesn't want (or isn't able) to set up a virtual system. So he uses RegSim. He finds desired key in the registry change interface and makes changes, which are immediately processed by the graphical simulator.
